# How to contribute to gitarro development

So you want to be a gitarro hacker!

Please follow theseg simple rules to make everyone's life easier, including yours :-)

1. First of all, fork the gitarro repository.

2. Then create a new branch at your forked repository, to create your feature or fox.

3. Work on the feature fix. You should have only one commit at each time, so we strongly suggest you use 'git commit --amend' and 'git push -f'. Otherwise you can perform a squash, but it is more complicated.

4. When you are happy, ensure that all [tests](TESTS.md) are passing.

5. Create a Pull Request and describe what your changes do. Travis will run some tests, so if any of them fails you will need to fix the problems.

6. Somebody will review your Pull Request ASAP, and will merge it or request some changes if needed.
